**Description:**  Timeline-based List Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in list format with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark, can be considered a specialized subset of ListQA that requires both list comprehension and temporal understanding. We investigate the temporal reasoning and list comprehension capabilities of state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models, particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align facts in a closed-book setup. To address these issues, we further explore how retrieval augmentation for the LLM in an open-domain setup can enhance performance in this task. Our results indicate that while augmenting with evidence from retrieval improves performance, there remains considerable room for further improvement in retrieval and downstream reasoning, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark and the evaluation of the models can be accessed at repo.
