Venktesh Viswanathan is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Web Information Systems (WIS)](https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/) at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (TU Delft). My research aims to develop *robust* and *efficient* pipelines for complex knowledge intensive tasks to assist in wide range of real-world applications like healthcare, education, research and tackling disinformation. My research his entails building **robust and efficient** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) through theoretically grounded advances in Machine Learning (ML) that bridge the **retrieval and reasoning gaps**. Towards realizing this vision, I have developed theoretically grounded **sample-efficient algorithms** for compute-optimal **test time scaling** at retrieval and reasoning stages. My work also involves developing **robust LLM-feedback approaches** based on uncertainty quantification to improve retrieval and reasoning at inference time. The resulting works have been published at **WWW,WSDM,ECIR,CIKM,EMNLP,NAACL and SIGIR**. I also regularly serve as Reviewer for **NAACL,ACL,EMNLP,SIGKDD,SIGIR,AAAI,CIKM,WSDM,WWW,ECIR**. Apart from publications my work has been deployed at scale for real-world impactful applications like **Live-factchecking** of US presidential and EU debates by Factiverse AI, Norway.

**During my PhD**, I worked on building efficient NLP and IR pipelines for content curation in online learning platforms. I was one fo the first members of Applied Data Science lab (https://ads-ai.github.io/) at IIIT-D.
     I independently executed several research projects such as concept retrieval, content tagging, question generation and question complexity identification from conceptualization to execution in an end to end manner.  During my PhD, I was the sole first author in 4 full papers and co first-author in 2 other papers at top venues like **IEEE TKDE '24, CIKM '23, ECML-PKDD'21 '22, AIED '22 and  ECIR '22**.
